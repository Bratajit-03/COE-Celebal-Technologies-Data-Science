# Prompt Generator

## Overview

The Prompt Generator is a Flask API-based web application that uses the Azure OpenAI Service with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate text responses based on user input. It features a simple frontend for user interaction and displays generated responses on the same page.

## Tech Stack Used:
- Flask
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure App Service
- Python

## Deploying the Flask API Using Azure App Service

First, I opened the Flask project in VS Code and installed the Azure App Service extension. Then, I signed in to my Azure account, created a new App Service, and deployed the Flask app directly from VS Code, making it accessible via a public URL.

## Testing the API by interacting with Webpage
I tested the API by interacting with the HTML/CSS app interface, which allows to submit prompts and view generated content directly in the browser.
